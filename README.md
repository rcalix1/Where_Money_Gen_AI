* Where is the Money in Generative AI?
* Essentially talk about the Tools for Gen AI and Transfer Learning
* AGS
* AI agents

## Artificial intelligence investments have increased substantially

* 10 billion from microsoft to OpenAI

## DeepSeek

* has changed AI a lot
* drive to more efficiency with less expense
  

## Split Path to Gen AI

* high level - use "as is" AI infrastructure ( software ) - Torch - HF, AI agents, replicate, etc.
* low level  - mod or hack the AI infrastructure ( software ) - Deep Seek - CUDA C/C++

# Career Pathing: Where is the Money in Generative AI?

## Section: Turning AI into Income with n8n Workflows

### 🧠 Why This Matters

LLMs are impressive, but they don't directly generate revenue.

**Businesses pay for outcomes**: leads generated, emails sent, tickets answered, contracts parsed.

That’s where **n8n** shines: it connects LLMs to real-world systems that do paid work.

## 🌐 The Stack: Where n8n Fits

| Layer            | Tool / Example             | Money Comes From...        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 🔢 Model Layer   | OpenAI, Claude, Mistral    | (Commoditized)             |
| 🧠 Agent Layer   | CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph | (Complex, still niche)     |
| ✨ Workflow Layer | **n8n**, Zapier, Make.com  | ✅ *Where business happens* |
| 💼 Value Layer   | HR, Legal, Sales, SaaS     | 💰 *Clients & cash*        |

---

## 🔧 Real Use Case: AI Sales Assistant in n8n

**Workflow:**

1. Trigger: New contact added to Airtable
2. n8n calls OpenAI to generate personalized intro email
3. n8n sends email via Gmail
4. n8n logs contact + status in Notion CRM
5. n8n waits 3 days → sends follow-up

💵 This workflow replaces a $3,000/month sales development rep (SDR).

## 💰 Monetizable n8n + LLM Workflows

| Use Case                 | Business Value Provided         | Revenue Potential |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Lead qualification agent | Faster sales funnel             | 💲💲💲            |
| Resume screener (HR)     | Cuts hours from hiring pipeline | 💲💲💲            |
| Shopify FAQ responder    | Reduces support cost            | 💲💲              |
| Contract analyzer        | Automates legal review          | 💲💲💲            |
| PDF Q&A system (RAG)     | Internal knowledge agent        | 💲💲💲            |

## Where is the Money in Generative AI?

* in terms of building out vertical and industry specific LLMs and models, and a lot of edge-use cases, ... that has not been settled yet, and ... that's where a lot of the innovation is going to come from
* ... this market is not just the handful of mega-cap names as the winners.
* Essentially the most important thing beyond the model training piece here is: What data do you have that's unique,
* that you can bring to bear to help clients? example ...cyber security
* So what really looking for is companies that have deep proprietary data
* that they can use to create differentiated use cases and experiences (https://www.vin.com/vin/)
* – the winners will be the picks and shovels (the hardware and infrastructure that support AI)
* and less money will be made by applications and features built on top.
