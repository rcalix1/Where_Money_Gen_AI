# Career Pathing: Where is the Money in Generative AI

* Career Pathing
* Where is the Money in Generative AI?
* Essentially talk about the Tools for Gen AI and Transfer Learning
* 

## Artificial intelligence investments have increased substantially

* 10 billion from microsoft to OpenAI 

## DeepSeek

* has changed AI a lot
* drive to more efficiency with less expense
* 

## Split Path to Gen AI

* high level - use "as is" AI infrastructure ( software ) - Torch - HF, AI agents, replicate, etc.
* low level  - mod or hack the AI infrastructure ( software ) - Deep Seek - CUDA C/C++

## Where to start with cuda

## History

* https://ourworldindata.org/brief-history-of-ai
* Perceptron and Transformers (software) - NN algorithms
* 2007 GPUs ( cloud )
* Data 

## The future

## Big Winners

* Cloud
* NVIDIA
* The only companies that can make this level of investment are: Meta, Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic.


## Career Pathing

* Transfer Learning (Pre-training vs. Fine-tuning)
* Cloud
* Data
* APIs
* Niche
* CUDA
  
## Where is the Money in Generative AI?

* in terms of building out vertical and industry specific LLMs and models, and a lot of edge-use cases, ... that has not been settled yet, and ... that's where a lot of the innovation is going to come from
* ... this market is not just the handful of mega-cap names as the winners.
* Essentially the most important thing beyond the model training piece here is: What data do you have that's unique,
* that you can bring to bear to help clients? example ...cyber security
* So what really looking for is companies that have deep proprietary data
* that they can use to create differentiated use cases and experiences (https://www.vin.com/vin/)
* â€“ the winners will be the picks and shovels (the hardware and infrastructure that support AI)
* and less money will be made by applications and features built on top.
